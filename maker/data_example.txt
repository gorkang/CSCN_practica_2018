I think best when those around me are very intelligent.
I am not satisfied unless I am thinking.
I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that
I must solve.
I would prefer complex to simple problems.
Simply knowing the answer rather than understanding the reasons for the answer to a problem is fine with me.
When I am figuring out a problem, what I see as the solution to a problem is more important than what others believe or say is the solution.
It's enough for me that something gets the job done, I don't care how or why it works.
